## About The Project

The project is in two parts.

- the messageServer which pulls data from the LiveScoreAPI, transform them in data and broadcast them
- the Twitterbot that listens to the messages and send them to twitter.

The two components can be developed in a fairly independent way.
Please refer to the README in each subdirectory.
